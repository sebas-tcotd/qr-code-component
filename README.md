### What I learned

This challenge was a way to learn some basic React concepts, as well as a primary structuring of the components. In the side of styling, more than a learning experience, was a reinforcement of the basic knowledge I acquired as a frontend developer. This is so that I don't forget them and keep looking for ways to innovate.

For the styles, I have followed some guidelines from [ITCSS](https://www.xfive.co/blog/itcss-scalable-maintainable-css-architecture/) so that I can better organize the proposed design.

Thus, the main CSS file looks like this:

```css
@import url("./styles/-generic.css");
@import url("./styles/-elements.css");
@import url("./styles/-components.css");
```
I think it's a nice, clean way to organize styling. It may be overwhelming for small projects, but for large ones it might be helpulf.
